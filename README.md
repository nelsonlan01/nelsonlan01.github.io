**This website would forecast to refactor and rebuild into MK2 version**

As a topic, the old website was started in 2012, and its layout was very outdated, having been coded in secondary school; modernisation work is underway. Stay tune.

Content will mainly remain the same, but AI will be utilised while converting HTML, CSS, and JS code. Some outdated and inaccurate content will also be adjusted.
